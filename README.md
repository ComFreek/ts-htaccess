# What's that?

Sample use of a .htaccess file in order to compile TypeScript files on-the-fly using PHP.

You only need to write `script.ts` in your HTML and the request will be forwarded to the PHP script.
This script will then load a cached version or recompile it.


# How to use this sample

1. Install Node.js if you have not done yet: http://nodejs.org/.
2. Install TypeScript using NPM: `npm install -g typescript`.
2. Put the whole repository on your (local) server.
3. Open `http://your.server/ts-htaccess/index.html` in your browser.

# How to use `TSCompiler.class.php`
If you want the output to get written into a file:
`TSCompiler::compile($options, $errorInfo);`

And if you just want a string:
`$str = TSCompiler::compileToStr($options, $errorInfo);`

The passed `$options` array can contain two values at the moment:

* `$options['inputFile']` The input file
* `$options['outputFile']` The output file which won't be used if you call the string function variant.

You can also specify a temp directory in the class file.
The files which are temporarily generated by `TSCompiler::compileToStr()` will be saved for a very short moment in this location.
